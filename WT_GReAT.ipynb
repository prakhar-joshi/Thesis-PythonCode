The moisture corrosion happens when a bearing is in contact with moisture (water or acid), while frictional corrosion is activated by relative movements between mating surfaces given certain friction conditions. Friction corrosion include freeting and false brinelling.  ' , \n",
    "                 'Abrasive Wear(Bearing):\\n Abrasive wear is also called particle wear or three body wear. The most intensive abrasive wear happens when a soft surface is cut by another hard surface. The second reason occurs when a third hard particle abrades another soft surface. The mechanisms for abrasive wear include microcutting, microfracture, pull-out and individual grains. Therefore, lubricant failures and contamination are incentives to cause wind turbine bearings abrasive wear. ' , \n",

If the lubricant cannot prevent metal-to-metal contact and sliding motion occurs under load, substantial frictional heat will be generated. This can cause momentary micro-welding and tearing as gears mate and separate. It occurs on corresponding tooth tips and roots and has a scuffed, torn, shiny silver or black appearance ' , \n",
    "                 'Gear Pitting:\\n A problem with pitting can be labeled as either initial, in which the surface is experiencing small pits to destructive, in which the pits are larger in diameter. Initial pitting may be a problem with the gears not fitting together properly. Destructive pitting is typically an issue with surface overload. ' , \n",
    "                 'Gear Crack:\\n Cracks can occur due to high temperature, high pressure, faituge or a combination of all three. Fatigue occurs over time in response to repetitive loading. Due to the application of load, the gear tooth is subject to bending leading to fatigue. The fatigues in the gear cause the formation of cracks in the root of the gear tooth, leading to the failure of gear tooth. ' , \n",

The symptoms are discoloration from gold to blue. The incentives for overheating contain heavy loads, inadequate heat paths and poor cooling systems.
